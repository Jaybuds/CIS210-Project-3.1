Project Summary:
The Grocery Item Tracker project aimed to create a program that tracks and analyzes item frequencies in a grocery list. It provides functionalities to load data from a backup file,
analyze an input file, save data to a backup file, search for an item, display all item frequencies, and show an item frequency histogram.

Strengths:

Implemented a clear and user-friendly menu interface.
Used object-oriented programming principles to organize code into a GroceryItemTracker class, enhancing readability and maintainability.
Implemented error handling for file operations, ensuring robustness.

Areas for Improvement:

Enhancing error handling for user inputs to prevent unexpected behavior.
Implementing input validation to handle incorrect user inputs more gracefully.
Refactoring repetitive code segments to improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy.

Challenges:

Managing the state of the program and ensuring that data remains consistent throughout different operations.
Overcame this challenge by carefully designing the program's structure and using object-oriented programming concepts to encapsulate data and functionality.
Struggled with clearing the frequency dat file upon ruiing the program wach time, it was adding to itself everytime.

Transferable Skills:

Object-oriented design principles, which are widely applicable in software development.
File handling and data manipulation techniques, useful for handling various types of data in different projects.

Maintainability, Readability, Adaptability:

Used comments throughout the code to explain functionality and improve readability.
Structured the code into modular functions and classes, making it easier to maintain and adapt for future changes.
Employed consistent coding style and naming conventions to improve readability and maintainability.
